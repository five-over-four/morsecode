# Morse code tool
Tap your keyboard's keys to generate morse code. You can input using `zxcvbnm,.` and `space`. The text will split onto two separate lines and various durations (such as how long a dash must be) can be adjusted manually. As the UI is just a .png image, you can switch it out with any custom image with the exact same name.

## The project
I wrote this program, because I couldn't find a very good morse practice tool that would allow me to write freely. I used [this tool](https://morse.withgoogle.com/learn/#) to learn the alphabet.
